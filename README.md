# Frontend Bootcamp / Days in the Web

> ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ This project is a work in progress! Issues and pull requests are encouraged. ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

## Welcome

In this two-day workshop you'll learn the basics of frontend development while building a working web app.

The first day provides an introduction to the fundamentals of the web: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is targeted at new and experienced developers alike. On the second day we'll dive into more advanced topics like TypeScript, testing, and state management. While the examples should be accessible to anyone, you'll get the most out of it if you have some prior experience with programming and web technologies.

## Getting set up

### Required software

Before starting, make sure your computer has the following installed:

- [Node/NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) (choose the **LTS** option)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
  - If using a Mac, also follow [these steps](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line) to install the `code` terminal command.
- React Developer Tools for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)

### Installing and running the project

#### 1. Find a good terminal program--we're going to use it a LOT!

- On a PC, you can do this with `cmd.exe` (or some terminal programs such as [cmder](https://cmder.net/))

- On a Mac, bring up a Terminal (inside Applications folder).

- For those who really want something fancy looking: [hyper](https://hyper.is/)

#### 2. Clone repo and npm install

First, `cd` to a good place to put your copy of the Git repo.

- Windows: run `cd %USERPROFILE%` (if using `cmd.exe`) or `cd ~` (if using Bash)
- Mac: Terminal automatically opens to your user directory (`/Users/you`)

Then run the following to make a local copy of the repo and get it ready to run:

```
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/frontend-bootcamp.git
cd frontend-bootcamp
npm install
```

If you have VS Code installed, type the following command to open a VS Code window where you can browse and open all the files in the project. (If on a Mac, be sure you've followed [these steps](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line) first to make the `code` command available.)

```
code .
```

#### 3. Run the "inner loop" build

For steps 1-3 on Day 1:

```
npm run static
```

For everything else:

```
npm start
```
