# Web Bootcamp/Day in the Web

## Purpose of this workshop

This repo is the content for a two day workshop focused on introducing you to the fundamentals of web development. By the end of these two days you will have better understanding of how we write and deliver features on the web. You will also get some hands on experience using everything from HTML, CSS and JavaScript to React, Redux and UI Fabric as we build a working application together.

## Who is this workshop for

This workshop starts as a very high level introduction to the core principles of the web: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This section is targeted at new and experienced developers alike. The second day dives into more complex topics such as Typescript and state management within an application. The examples should be accessible to anyone, but you will get more out of the day if you have some foundational experience in programing or web technologies.
