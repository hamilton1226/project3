## Exercise

If you already have the app running from a previous step, stop it with `ctrl+C`. Start the app version used in this step by running `npm start` from the root of the `frontend-bootcamp` folder. Click the "exercise" link under day 1 step 5 to see results.

### TodoFooter

1. Update the TodoFooter component, copying over the `<footer>` tag and all of its children
2. Remove any `onclick` properties, and change `class` to `className`

### TodoList

1. Update the TodoList component like you did with the footer.
2. Import TodoListItem and add 4 of them inside of the `<ul>`
3. Bonus points for using a [`for`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration) loop or using [`map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) to create 4 list items based on the array `[1,2,3,4]`
