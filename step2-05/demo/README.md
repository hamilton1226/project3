# Step 2.5 - Redux: The Store (Demo)

[Lessons](../) | [Exercise](./exercise/) | [Demo](./demo/)

In this step, we will look at solving the problems of complex application (as mentioned in Step 4) with a library called Redux.

1. Introduction to Redux
2. Creating the Redux store
3. Writing reducers
4. Dispatching actions

---

As a reminder, the problem that we want to address are:

1. Data needs to be passed down from component to component via props. Even when some components do not need to know about some data.
2. There is a lack of coordination of changes that can happen to the data

Redux is an implementation of the Flux architectural pattern:

### View

A view is a React component that consumes the store as its data.

### Action

[Actions](https://redux.js.org/basics/actions) are messages that represent some event, such as a user's action or a network request. With the aid of _reducers_, they affect the overall state.

### Store

The [store](https://redux.js.org/basics/store) consists of a **state tree**, a **dispatcher**, and **reducers**.

1. A state tree is a **singleton**, **serializable**, **immutable** json data. It is updated from one snapshot to another through `reducers`.

2. A dispatcher accepts actions passing them to the reducers.

3. Reducers are functions that take in the current state tree and an action, producing the next snapshot of the state tree.

# Creating the Redux store

The [`createStore()`](https://redux.js.org/api/createstore) function is provided by Redux and can take in several arguments. The simplest form just takes in reducers.

```ts
const store = createStore(reducer, initialState);
```

`createStore()` creates a store with a reducer, and some initial state.

# Writing Reducers

We will write our reducers with the help of some utilities from `redux-starter-kit`. Here is how we will write our reducers:

## 1. Organize reducers according to the keys of the state tree object:

```ts
import { createReducer } from 'redux-starter-kit';

const todosReducer = createReducer({}, {
  // first argument is the initial state
  // second argument is an object where the keys corresponds to the "action.type"
  addTodo: (state, action) => ...
});

const filterReducer = createReducer('all', {
  setFilter: (state, action) => ...
});

const reducer = combineReducer({
  todos: todosReducer,
  filter: filterReducer
})
```

## 2. Write the reducers with mutables.

`createReducer()` will automatically translate all the mutations to the state into immutable snapshots (!!!!!):

```ts
const todosReducer = createReducer(
  {},
  {
    // first argument is the initial state
    // second argument is an object where the keys corresponds to the "action.type"
    addTodo: (state, action) => {
      state[action.id] = { label: action.label, completed: false };
    }
  }
);
```

# Dispatching Actions

Dispatching action will pass the action and the current state to the _reducers_. The root _reducer_ will produce a new snapshot for the entire state tree. We can inspect the affected snapshot with the help of `getState()`.

```ts
const store = createStore(reducer, initialState);
store.dispatch({ type: 'addTodo', label: 'hello' });
store.dispatch({ type: 'addTodo', label: 'world' });
console.log(store.getState());
```

Creating these action messages by hand is tedious, so we use action creators to do that:

```ts
const actions = {
  addTodo = (label: string) => ({ label, id: nextId(), completed: false })
};

store.dispatch(actions.addTodo('hello'));
```
