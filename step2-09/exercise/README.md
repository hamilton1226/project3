If you don't already have the app running, start it by running `npm start` from the root of the `frontend-bootcamp` folder. Click the "exercise" link under day 2 step 9 to see results.

1. open up `exercise/src/service/index.ts` and study the signature of the functions to call the service such as the `add()` function

2. open `exercise/src/actions/index.ts` and fill in the missing content inside `actionsWithService`

- note that the `complete` and `clear` functions require you to write your own wrapper function

3. open `exercise/src/index.tsx` and follow the instructions in the TODO comment to make the app prepopulate with data from the service.
